# PART 2: PSYCHOLOGY & MENTAL MODELS

## Foundational Thinking Models

### First Principles
Break problems down to basic truths. Don't copy competitors—ask "why" repeatedly to find root causes.

**Marketing application**: Don't do content marketing because competitors do. Ask why, what problem it solves, if there's a better solution.

### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
People "hire" products to get a job done. Focus on outcomes, not features.

**Marketing application**: A drill buyer wants a hole, not a drill. Frame around the job accomplished.

### Circle of Competence
Know what you're good at and stay within it. Double down on genuine expertise.

**Marketing application**: Don't chase every channel. Focus on where you have real competitive advantage.

### Inversion
Ask what would guarantee failure, then avoid those things.

**Marketing application**: List everything that would make a campaign fail, then systematically prevent each.

### Occam's Razor
Simpler explanations are usually correct. Avoid overcomplicating strategies.

**Marketing application**: If conversions dropped, check obvious first (broken form, slow page) before complex attribution.

### Pareto Principle (80/20)
80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Find and focus on the vital few.

**Marketing application**: Find channels driving most results. Cut or reduce the rest.

### Hick's Law
Decision time increases with options. More choices = more abandonment.

**Marketing application**: One clear CTA beats three. Fewer form fields = higher conversion.

### AIDA Funnel
Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

**Marketing application**: Structure pages to move through each stage. Capture attention before building desire.

### Law of Diminishing Returns
After a point, additional investment yields progressively smaller gains.

**Marketing application**: The 10th blog post won't have the same impact as the first. Diversify channels.

### Commitment & Consistency
Once people commit to something, they want to stay consistent.

**Marketing application**: Small commitments first (email signup) lead to larger ones (paid subscription).

### Reciprocity Principle
Give first. People feel obligated to return favors.

**Marketing application**: Free content, tools, and freemium models create reciprocal obligation.

### Scarcity & Urgency
Limited availability increases perceived value.

**Marketing application**: Limited-time offers, low-stock warnings. Only use when genuine.

### Loss Aversion
Losses feel twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good.

**Marketing application**: "Don't miss out" beats "You could gain." Frame in terms of what they'll lose.

### Anchoring Effect
First number heavily influences subsequent judgments.

**Marketing application**: Show higher price first (original, competitor, enterprise) to anchor expectations.

### Paradox of Choice
Too many options overwhelm. Fewer choices lead to more decisions.

**Marketing application**: Three pricing tiers. Recommend a single "best for most" option.

### Endowment Effect
People value things more once they own them.

**Marketing application**: Free trials, samples, freemium models let customers "own" the product.

### IKEA Effect
People value things they put effort into creating.

**Marketing application**: Let customers customize, configure, build. Their investment increases commitment.

### Mere Exposure Effect
Familiarity breeds liking. Consistent presence builds preference.

**Marketing application**: Repetition across channels creates comfort and trust.

### Social Proof / Bandwagon Effect
People follow what others are doing. Popularity signals quality.

**Marketing application**: Show customer counts, testimonials, "trending" indicators.

### Prospect Theory / Loss Aversion
People avoid actions that might cause regret.

**Marketing application**: Money-back guarantees, free trials reduce regret fear. Address concerns directly.

### Zeigarnik Effect
Unfinished tasks occupy the mind. Open loops create tension.

**Marketing application**: "You're 80% done" creates pull to finish. Incomplete profiles, abandoned carts.

### Status-Quo Bias
People prefer current state. Change feels risky.

**Marketing application**: Reduce friction. Make transition feel safe. "Import in one click."

### Default Effect
People accept pre-selected options. Defaults are powerful.

**Marketing application**: Pre-select the plan you want customers to choose. Opt-out beats opt-in.

### Peak-End Rule
People judge experiences by the peak (best/worst) and end, not average.

**Marketing application**: Design memorable peaks and strong endings. Thank you pages matter.

# MSPOT Generator

## What is MSPOT?

One-page strategic clarity (from HubSpot):
- **M**ission: Why we exist (rarely changes)
- **S**trategy: How we'll win this period
- **P**rojects: The 3-5 big bets
- **O**missions: What we're explicitly NOT doing
- **T**racking: How we'll measure success

## Why It Works

1. **Forces Omissions:** Saying NO is harder and more valuable
2. **Limits Projects:** 3-5 max prevents spreading thin
3. **One Page:** If it doesn't fit, it's not clear
4. **Trackable:** Decision-useful metrics only

## Output Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
MSPOT: [Name]
Period: [Timeframe] | Owner: [Person]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

MISSION: [One sentence: Why this exists]

STRATEGY: [2-3 sentences: How we'll win]

PROJECTS (3-5 max):
1. [Name] - Outcome: [X] - Owner: [Y] - Due: [Z]
2. [Name] - Outcome: [X] - Owner: [Y] - Due: [Z]
3. [Name] - Outcome: [X] - Owner: [Y] - Due: [Z]

OMISSIONS:
✗ NOT [X] - Because: [reason]
✗ NOT [Y] - Because: [reason]

TRACKING:
Lead: [Activity] → Target: [X]
Lag: [Result] → Target: [Y] by [date]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Key Questions

| Section | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Mission** | "If we succeed, what changes?" |
| **Strategy** | "What's our unfair advantage?" |
| **Projects** | "If only 3 things, which ones?" |
| **Omissions** | "What are we tempted to do but shouldn't?" |
| **Tracking** | "What number tells us we're winning?" |

## Integration

Compounds with:
- **pre-mortem-analyst** → Pre-mortem each Project before committing
- **inversion-strategist** → Invert to find Omissions
- **artem-decision-journal** → Log major MSPOT decisions
